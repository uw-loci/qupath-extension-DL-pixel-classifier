/**
 * Fires when INT8 inference is enabled. The INT8 path depends on
 * BatchRenorm being folded to BatchNorm at export time, which is
 * only safe once BRN's running statistics have converged. Very
 * short training runs (&lt;20 epochs) can produce BRN running
 * stats that are still noisy, so the folded BN graph may drift
 * from the training-time behaviour.
 * <p>
 * The E.3 Python-side fix adds an epoch threshold on
 * {@code fold_brn_to_bn} that skips the BN-folded export when
 * training is too short. This watcher surfaces the caveat to the
 * user at preference-toggle time so they know why INT8 may fall
 * back to FP16 on short-trained models.
 * <p>
 * Severity is INFO -- composition is correct, this is an
 * expectation-setting popup.
